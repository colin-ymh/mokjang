Ship the current branch as a pull request.

Goal:
Prepare a safe commit and PR flow for the current branch.
Do not skip validation steps.

Instructions:

1. Review the current branch, git status, and git diff first.
2. If the current branch is `main` or `master`, stop and report that shipping must happen from a feature branch.
3. If there are no meaningful changes, stop and report that there is nothing to ship.
4. Run the required quality gates before any commit (turbo monorepo, run from repo root):
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run lint`
     (이 프로젝트에는 자동화된 테스트 러너가 없으므로 test 단계는 생략한다. 테스트가 추가되면 여기에 포함할 것.)
5. If any quality gate fails, stop immediately and report:
   - which command failed
   - the important error summary
   - what needs to be fixed before shipping
6. Summarize the current changes:
   - changed files
   - change summary
   - QA / regression review
   - risks or items needing confirmation
7. Suggest 3 commit message options in a consistent project style.
8. Choose the best commit message unless the user has already provided one.
9. Stage changes and create a commit.
10. Push the current branch to origin.
11. Create a pull request with `gh pr create`.
12. Return the final shipping summary.

Pull request body should include:

- Summary
- What changed
- Validation
- Risks / follow-up

Validation rules:

- Do not commit if typecheck or lint failed.
- Do not push directly to `main` or `master`.
- Do not create a PR without first reviewing the diff.
- Keep the PR title aligned with the selected commit message.

Output format:

- Branch name
- Changed files
- Change summary
- QA / regression review
- Risks or items needing confirmation
- Selected commit message
- PR title
- PR summary
- Final result
